**About**  
My grandson asked me about setting up a webpage or app with a dashboard for NCAA or NBA stats. I wanted to be able to show him how to scrape the stats and use it to make predictions before moving on to the dashboard, but I needed more practice myself before teaching him. 

**Data**  
For this project, I scraped data from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) since it had a table with MVP data that was easier to scrape. Eventually, I'll use data drectly from the NBA website and other the relevant sites for other sports.

**To Use**  
The notebooks are numbered to make it easy to start and end with the correct ones. Make sure to look at the folders you'll need to set up for yourself before running the notebooks. Or get used to seeing errors.üòÅ

**Next Steps**  
My next step is to look at some dashboards that others have done to decide how I want to set mine up. I'll use Streamlit to set up the dashboard. After that, we'll start working on the NFL and whatever other sport he wants to work on.
