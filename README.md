My grandson asked me about setting up a webpage or app with a dashboard for NCAA or NBA stats. I wanted to be able to show him how to scrape the stats and use it to make predictions before moving on to the dashboard, but I needed more practice myself before teaching him. 

To use this repo, use the numbered files in order to scrape the data from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). Eventually, I'll use data drectly from the NBA website, but the basketball-reference site has the MVP data in a format that's easier to scrape.

**Next Steps**  
My next step is to look at some dashboards that others have done to decide how I want to set mine up. I'll use Streamlit to set up the dashboard. After that, we'll start working on the NFL and whatever other sport he wants to work on.
